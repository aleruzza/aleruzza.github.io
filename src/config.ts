    "Ph.D researcher in astrophysics at the University of Milano, working on protoplanetary discs, planet formation and automatic methods for the characterization of young planets. I run numerical simulations of protoplanetary disc models, use and develop deep learning models for simulation-based \
inference (SBI) and apply the developed pipelines to actual observations. SITE UNDER CONSTRUCTION!",
